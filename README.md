Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that enables you to manage and provision infrastructure resources in a cloud-agnostic way. It uses a declarative approach to define and manage infrastructure resources, and supports various cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and more.
Terraform provides a simple and intuitive domain-specific language (DSL) to define infrastructure resources, which is declarative in nature. With the help of Terraform, you can manage complex infrastructure setups as code, version control your infrastructure changes, and share your stacks with others, just like any other code.
Here's a basic workflow in Terraform: 1. Write Terraform configuration code using the Terraform Domain Specific Language (DSL) (e.g., HCL) 2. Initialize the Terraform project using the  command. This will download the required provider plugins and initialize the working directory. 3. Plan the infrastructure changes using the  command which will show the expected changes and resources that Terraform will provision. 4. Apply the changes using the  command to provision the infrastructure resources as per the Terraform configuration.
Terraform also provides many other features such as state management, remote backend storage, and third-party modules, which make it a powerful tool for infrastructure management and provisioning.
